Memory from today's GitHub Party: Great f00d!!! Amazing people! Even understood a little french and proud of Savoire Linux.
Hope to learn French soon after graduation and apply for a job here since I used to enjoy working on linux platform,
programming in python and now, I'm growing to love GitHub.

Need practice so will work on this :)

Cheers guys!
