Repository to introduce github, easily, awesomely!

This repository was used for the PyLadies Montreal MeetUp on October 8th, 2015, http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesMTL/events/225801036/?a=socialmedia. 

Its purpose is to provide a platform for practicing and playing with the different functions in github, without being afraid of breaking anything at all!

The slides for the workshop can be found at
http://helloworld-pyladiesmtl.bitballoon.com/#/pyladies.
If you want to follow the workshop offline, give it a try. I will answer your
pull requests and comments. 

If you have any comments, corrections or improvements please let me know. 

Let's have fun.
