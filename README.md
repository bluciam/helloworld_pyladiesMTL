Repository to introduce github, easily, awesomely!

This repository will be used for the the PyLadies Montreal MeetUp 8 October 2015, http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesMTL/events/225801036/?a=socialmedia. 

The purpose of this project is to provide a platform for practicing and playing with the different functions in github, without being afraid of breaking anything at all!

Let's have lots of fun.
